        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            My approach to the design of this website was to create a lightweight 
            website with minimal clutter. It must be easy to navigate for users, and
            the information conveyed must be short and concise.
        </p>
        <p class="centeredp">~About the colours~</p>
        <p>    
            I really wanted to make the website with a 
            little 'retro' feel, So I went for a beige coloured background and having 
            thick borders around all of my images. The colour also acts as a blue
            light filter, making it easier on the reader's eyes. For UI elements, purple 
            felt appropriate as it is the primary color of the university. Hovered elements
            are yellow as it is the complement of purple, and makes a rare and unique colour
            combination.
        </p>
        <p class="centeredp">~Why so many places?~</p>
        <p>
            I used a lot of places on the F&B and to a lesser extent the Picnic Spots page 
            to try and demonstrate my use of media queries to toggle the flex display from 
            elements which were initially in blocks. A minimum width was set to ensure readers
            could identify seperate sections even on narrow screens like mobile devices.

    <h2>Menu System</h2>
    <p>
        The navbar menu system was heavily modified from <a href="https://responsivenavigation.net/examples/simple-toggle/ ">simple-toggle</a>. 
        I chose to avoid the other options because of the use of javascript, and my 
        reluctance to use something I do not fully understand. This one was perfect 
        as I did not have many pages and most of them could be placed in the footer.
        In mobile view, clicking is really easy and in desktop mode, the navbar becomes inline
        to increase space for the main content.
