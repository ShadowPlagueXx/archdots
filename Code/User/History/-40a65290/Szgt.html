      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          My approach to the design of this website was to create a lightweight 
          website with minimal clutter. It must be easy to navigate for users, and
          the information conveyed must be short and concise.
      </p>
      <p class="centeredp">~About the colours~</p>
      <p>    
          I really wanted to make the website with a 
          little 'retro' feel, So I went for a beige coloured background and having 
          thick borders around all of my images. The colour also acts as a blue
          light filter, making it easier on the reader's eyes. For UI elements, purple 
          felt appropriate as it is the primary color of the university. Hovered elements
          are yellow as it is the complement of purple, and makes a rare and unique colour
          combination.
      </p>
      <p class="centeredp">~Why so many places?~</p>
      <p>
          I used a lot of places on the F&B and to a lesser extent the Picnic Spots page 
          to try and demonstrate my use of media queries to toggle the flex display. A minimum width was set to ensure readers
          could identify seperate sections even on narrow screens like mobile devices.

      <p class="centeredp">~Breakpoints & Tweakpoints~</p>
      <p>
          Time constraints limited the scope of the project's breakpoints. As this website is mobile 
          first, one breakpoint was set at a common breakpoint of 992px for desktop. And a tweakpoint
          at 768px to accomodate tablet users. When the screen width exceeds the tweakpoint at 768px,
          the navbar changes to the inline mode. This is to prevent the navbar from taking up valuable real
          estate. Past the breakpoint at 992px, the main page changes to accomodate all the information 
          in one view without needing to scroll down. In addition to that, the image containers in the F&B 
          and Picnics page are each shortened to a width of 45% to allow 2 to appear side by side. This both prevents
          the images from getting too big and also allows more info to be obtained faster by the 
          user.

      <h2>Menu System</h2>
      <p>
          The navbar menu system was heavily modified from 
          <a href="https://responsivenavigation.net/examples/simple-toggle/ ">simple-toggle</a>. 
          I chose to avoid the other options because of the use of javascript, and my 
          reluctance to use something I do not fully understand. This one was perfect 
          as I did not have many pages and most of them could be placed in the footer.
          In mobile view, clicking is really easy and in desktop mode, the navbar becomes inline
          to increase space for the main content.
